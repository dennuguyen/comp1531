# Tutorial 07

- Design principles
- User Stories

## Activities

### Activity 1

Break up into your project groups. Spend 20 minutes together as a team looking through your iteration 2 code. Identify at least 2 segments of code in your repository that you think contain design smells. Discuss what principles can be applied to fix these problems and how specifically you would refactor the code to fix them. During this time, your tutor will move from group to group to hear how you're approaching this and provide guidance on possible smells you may have missed.

### Activity 2

In groups of 3, 4 or 5 (could be your project groups; doesn't have to be), consider a university timetabling system that helps students find the best timetable for them. Students can enter the courses they want to do, the times they are otherwise busy, and their preference for late starts, whole days off, free lunch hours, etc. The system would generate possible timetables that don't clash with their other commitments and best suit their preferences.

Write 3 or 4 user stories for this system. Use INVEST as a guide for deciding their granularity and specificity.

For 2 of the stories, try to write some acceptance criteria. They can be in either rule-based or scenario-based format.

Your tutor will move from group to group to provide feedback and guidance.
