# Tutorial 1

## A. Introduction

1. Your tutor will split you up into pairs. Once in a pair, introduce yourself.

2. Your tutor will start a timer. Try to come up with a new name for your partnership comprised of all or some of the letters of your full names (bonus points for using ALL the letters)

3. The class will pick their favourite from the whole class and write it on the board.

4. Find another person in the class you don't know and repeat the process, trying to come up with a "better" name than the one on the board.

5. Reflect with your tutor on any challenges you faced in the exercise

## B. Problem solving

1. Your tutor will help separate you into groups of 4.

2. As a group, your tutor is going to give you a problem to solve in 10 minutes. At the end, they'll ask for your answers.

3. Reflect with your tutor on how you came up with those answers

## C. Python

1. Write a basic python program that:
 * Prompts the user to enter a number
 * Reads in a number from command line
 * Prints the square of that number; unless the number is not valid, then prints an error

2. How would you modify this program to re-prompt the user for input if an invalid number is given?

## D. Discussion

As a class, discuss the following:

1. Should a software engineering process always yield the same result for the same requirements, regardless of who is involved?

2. How important is detail in the requirements? Can you have too much or too little detail?

3. Should a process require all requirements to be fully known and specified in detail before the project starts?

4. What is the distinction between good practices and a process?

5. What are traits you believe make good team members? How do you decide who you to pick in a group for the project?

6. Is python a good programming language?
