MINUTES - 9/3/20:

Present: Raymond, Dan

auth
- token, authentication hash
- multiple login assumption changed to same token
- auth token is time complex?

slackr owner permissions
- submit merge request for channels anyways where slackr owner joins every channel (for iteration 1)
- Consider Raymond's suggested alternate method for slackr owner permissions:
    e.g. def channel_addowner():
            if u_id in channel_details() or **u_id == 1**

- review the code:
    - if test does not go under exception then do nothing except for invalid token which always raises AccessError
    - white space name for loop
    - warnings and errors in other test files

TIPS FOR IT 3
- hidden user feature
- make slackr owner a hidden user
